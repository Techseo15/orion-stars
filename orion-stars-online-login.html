                    <p style="color: #333; margin-bottom: 15px;">This calculator helps players understand the effective credit they receive for their purchases, especially with Orion Stars bonuses. The formula is straightforward:</p>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; color: #0056b3; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">Total Credits = Base Credit Purchase × (1 + Bonus Tier Percentage)</p>
                    <p style="color: #333; margin-bottom: 20px;">For example, if you purchase 100 base credits and select a 10% bonus tier, the calculation is 100 × (1 + 0.10) = 100 × 1.10 = 110 total credits. The calculator dynamically updates based on your input.</p>
