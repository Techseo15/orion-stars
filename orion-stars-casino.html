                        <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr; gap: 15px;">
                            <div class="grid-item" style="background-color: #ffffff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.08);">
                                <strong style="color: #2196f3; display: block; margin-bottom: 5px;"><i class="fa fa-dollar-sign" style="margin-right: 8px;"></i>Credit Purchase:</strong>
                                <p style="font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.5;">Input the amount of money you plan to spend on credits. This is the base value for your gaming. The calculator will use this to determine your bonus tier.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="grid-item" style="background-color: #ffffff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.08);">

                                <p style="font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.5;">This represents a simplified average return on your total credits. It's a hypothetical percentage (e.g., 85% means for every 100 credits played, you expect 85 back). This helps estimate potential winnings over time.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="grid-item" style="background-color: #ffffff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.08);">

                                <p style="font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.5;">Orion Stars Casino offers varying bonus percentages based on your purchase amount. This calculator implements a simplified tiered system to estimate the bonus credits you receive.</p>
                                <ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0; margin-top: 10px;">

                                </ul>
                            </div>
                            <div class="grid-item" style="background-color: #ffffff; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.08);">
                                <strong style="color: #2196f3; display: block; margin-bottom: 5px;"><i class="fa fa-coins" style="margin-right: 8px;"></i>Estimated Winnings Formula:</strong>
                                <p style="font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.5;">This tool uses a simple formula: <strong style="color: #0d47a1;">Total Credits = Purchase Amount + Bonus Credits</strong>, and <strong style="color: #0d47a1;">Estimated Winnings = Total Credits × (Hypothetical Win Rate / 100)</strong>. This provides a basic projection of what you might expect.</p>
                                <p style="font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.5;">For example, if you purchase $100 (Silver tier, 10% bonus), you get $10 bonus credits, for a total of $110 credits. With an 85% win rate, your estimated winnings are $110 * 0.85 = $93.50. This demonstrates the power of extra credits.</p>
