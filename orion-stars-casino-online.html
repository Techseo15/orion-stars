                <h3><i class="fas fa-question-circle" style="color: #007bff;"></i> Understanding the Estimator</h3>
                <p>The Orion Stars Casino Credit Estimator is a tool designed to provide a theoretical projection of your gaming session. It helps you visualize how different variables affect your credit balance. This is particularly useful for planning long-term play or for budgeting specific gaming sessions.</p>
                <p>It operates on the principle of average spending and an estimated win rate, which are key components of any online casino activity. The calculator provides a snapshot of what could happen under specific conditions, allowing for better strategic decisions while playing Orion Stars games.</p>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-cogs" style="color: #007bff;"></i> How the Estimator Works</h3>
                <p>The core of the estimator lies in its straightforward calculation logic. It first determines the total credits you might spend based on your desired play duration and your average spending per minute. This gives you a clear outgoing credit figure.</p>
                <p>Next, it takes your starting credits, subtracts the estimated credits spent, and then adds back potential winnings based on your estimated win rate. This provides a hypothetical final credit balance. It simplifies complex variables into easily digestible numbers for your Orion Stars experience.</p>
                <p>The primary formula used is:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin-top: 15px;">
                    <li style="background-color: #e0f2f7; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #007bff; margin-bottom: 8px; border-radius: 4px;"><strong>Total Credits Spent = Play Duration (minutes) &times; Avg. Credits Spent Per Minute</strong></li>
                    <li style="background-color: #f0faff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #007bff; margin-bottom: 8px; border-radius: 4px;"><strong>Estimated Final Credits = Starting Credits - Total Credits Spent + (Total Credits Spent &times; Estimated Win Rate / 100)</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-chart-line" style="color: #007bff;"></i> Example Calculations</h3>
                <p>To illustrate the estimator's utility, let's consider a few scenarios. These examples demonstrate how changes in inputs affect the projected outcomes, helping you to better plan your Orion Stars play. Understanding these variations can lead to more informed decisions.</p>
                <p>Reviewing these examples can provide practical insights into managing your credits efficiently. This helps you to approach your Orion Stars Casino Online sessions with a clear strategy. Always remember these are estimates and actual results may vary.</p>
