            <h3>Bonus Estimation Formula and Examples</h3>

                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Using the table above, if a Platinum VIP member wagers $5,000 in a month, their estimated cashback would be $5,000 * 2.0% = $100. For free credits, it would be ($5,000 / $1000) * $20 = $100. This example clarifies how the rates are applied to calculate potential bonuses within the Orion Stars VIP App.</p>
